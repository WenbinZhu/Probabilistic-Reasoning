Principles of Artificial Intelligence: Probabilistic Reasoning and Decision-Making

- Hangman(Java): A [Hangman game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)), giving next best guess and its probability using Bayes deduction for belief networks

- Handwritten_Classification(Python): Recognition of handwritten digits 3 and 5 using logistic regression with Newton's method or gradient ascend

- LWsimulation(Java): Stochastic simulation (likehood weighting) for estimation of a belief network

- Language_Modeling(Python): Statistical language modeling for unigram, bigram and a mixture model

- Stock_Prediction(Python): Prediction of the Nasdaq stock market price

- EM-NoisyOR(Java): Use Expectation Maximum for classification

- Viterbi(Python): Use Viterbi alogorithm for speech recognition, decoding a sentense from observations, given a Hidden Markov Model

- Reinforcement_Learning(Python): Use value iteration and policy iteration in reinforcement learning to slove the maze problem
